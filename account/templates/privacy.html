                            <p>&bull;We’ve updated the Policy to reflect changes in data privacy laws</p>
                            <p>&bull;We’ve added details about your ability to manage the information you share with us, and the new tools we’ve created to help you do that.</p>
                        </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>This updated Policy gives you more control over your information and more clearly explains how we use it. Our core commitments regarding your privacy haven’t changed, including the commitment in our Charter to never sell your data.</p>
                        <p>You can read the updated Policy below. The Privacy Policy that’s in effect until May 24, 2018 can still be accessed here. You can look at a comparison of the two Policies here. We’re also making some related changes to our Terms of Use and Cookie Policy so everything’s in sync. As always, thanks for using CrowdFunding, and please let us know if you have any questions or feedback.</p>

New versions of this Policy will never apply retroactively — we’ll tell you the exact date they go into effect. If you keep using CrowdFunding after a change, that means you accept this Policy.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>This Policy describes the information we collect from you, how we use that information and our legal basis for doing so. It also covers whether and how that information may be shared and your rights and choices regarding the information you provide to us. If you see a capitalized word, it’s defined in our Terms of Use. We use cookies and similar technologies, as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>
                        <p>By using the Services offered by CrowdFunding, you’re acknowledging you have agreed to our Terms of Use and that you have read and understood this Privacy Policy and our Cookie Policy.</p>

                        <p>In order for you to create an account on CrowdFunding and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:</p>
                    </div>
                        <p>In order for you to create an account on CrowdFunding and use our Services, we need to collect and process certain information. Depending on your use of the Services, that may include:</p>

                        <p>Information you provide by completing forms on CrowdFunding — your name, email and postal addresses, telephone number, country of residence, login, and password details. We may ask for this information if you register as a user of the Services, subscribe to our newsletters, upload or submit content through CrowdFunding, or if you contact us;</p>
                        <p>Information you provide for identity verification purposes when launching a project, including your legal name, business name and Tax ID for business entities, and date of birth. In some cases, our payment processor will request that you provide a secure upload of an identity document (such as your passport, drivers license or other government-issued ID) to CrowdFunding;</p>
                        <p>Details of any requests or transactions you make through the Services. CrowdFunding partners with other companies (such as Stripe) for payment processing, and the payment information you submit is collected and used by them in accordance with their privacy policies (for Stripe’s, click here). CrowdFunding doesn’t store your payment information apart from the last four digits of your credit card or bank account (as applicable), expiration date, and country, which we require for tax, government regulatory, and security purposes;</p>
                        <p>Information about your activity on and interaction with CrowdFunding, including use of our mobile apps (such as your IP address, the type of device or browser you use, and your actions on the Site);</p>
                        <p>Information about the ways people visit and interact with our Site, in the form of traffic analytics. You can opt out of being included in Google Analytics here. For more information about our use of data analytics to protect and improve our Services, see our Cookie Policy;</p>
                        <p>Communications you send to us (for example, when you ask for support, send us questions or comments, or report a problem);</p>
                        <p>Information that you submit on or to CrowdFunding in the form of comments, contributions to discussions, or messages to other users; and</p>
                        <p>The email address associated with your Facebook account, if you choose to sign up using your Facebook credentials. CrowdFunding will also request permission to access your name, profile picture, and friend list (these permissions are governed by Facebook’s privacy policies and can be managed through your Facebook privacy settings). We never post anything to your Facebook, Twitter, or other third-party accounts without your permission.</p>

                        <p>You may decline to provide us with your information. However, this will limit your ability to register for an account or use our Services. You may pledge to a project as a guest by providing only an email address. However, to adjust your pledge, save payment details for future pledges, make project comments and take most other actions on our Site, you will need to finish creating an account. You may review, change or remove your information through your account settings.</p>
